Old legacy code will break, we are sorry but it is necessary to provide a cleaner interface. Please check the new code.*\r\n- *Methods renamed to give a more consistent feel to the API - all methods are now camelCase watch out for typo's!*\r\n- *Initial movement towards bringing the code into alignment with PSR-2 (http://www.php-fig.org/psr/2/)*\r\n- *There is absolutely NO, NONE, NADA, ZIP, 100% FREE of any need to use/enter a MAC address or IMEI in this code. DO NOT TRY!*\r\n- *[New Android token used](https://github.com/karolsarnacki/whatsapp/commit/55d8233b852ecd9f6a6f845586e91e6fadbd0c44#L1L20) as WP7 one appears to no longer work. Long live the WP7 token?*\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Note June 18th, 2013\r\n\r\n*Big overhaul in the code. Big thanks to:*\r\n- *[Ali Hubail](https://github.com/hubail) and*\r\n- *[Ahmed Moh'd](fb.com/ahmed.mhd) for making this project happen (and adding me as a member)*\r\n- *[Jannik Vogel](https://github.com/JayFoxRox) for helping me retrieve the latest WhatsApp token, someone should write a book about it some day..*\r\n- *[Tarek Galal](https://github.com/tgalal) for providing the latest WhatsApp functionality in yowsup*\r\n- *[Atans](https://github.com/atans) and*\r\n- *[Jonathan Williamson](https://github.com/jonnywilliamson) for additional fixes*\r\n\r\n*\\- [shirioko](https://github.com/shirioko)*\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n### What is WhatsApp?\r\nAccording to [the company](http://www.whatsapp.com/):\r\n\r\n> “WhatsApp Messenger is a cross-platform mobile messenger that replaces SMS and works through the existing internet data plan of your device. WhatsApp is available for iPhone, BlackBerry, Android, Windows Phone, Nokia Symbian60 & S40 phones. Because WhatsApp Messenger uses the same internet data plan that you use for email and web browsing, there is no cost to message and stay in touch with your friends.”\r\n\r\nLate 2011 numbers: 1 billion messages per day, ~20 million users.\r\n\r\n### Modified XMPP\r\nWhatsApp uses some sort of customized XMPP server, named internally as FunXMPP, which is basically some extended proprietary version.\r\n\r\n### Login procedure\r\nMuch like XMPP, WhatsApp uses JID (jabber id) and password to successfully login to the service. The password is generated by the server and received upon registration.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe JID is a concatenation between your country’s code and mobile number.\r\n\r\nInitial login uses Digest Access Authentication.\r\n\r\n### Message sending\r\nMessages are basically sent as TCP packets, following WhatsApp’s own format (unlike what’s defined in XMPP RFCs).\r\n\r\nMessages are application level encrypted using RC4 keystreams\r\n\r\n### Multimedia Message sending\r\nPhotos, Videos and Audio files shared with WhatsApp contacts are HTTP-uploaded to a server before being sent to the recipient(s) along with Base64 thumbnail of media file (if applicable) along with the generated HTTP link as the message body.\r\n\r\n### Event system\r\nWhatsApi uses an event manager (created by [facine](https://github.com/facine)) which allows you to respond to certain events.\r\n\r\nList of events and example code on how to bind an event handler:\r\nhttps://github.com/shirioko/WhatsAPI/wiki/WhatsApi-events\r\n\r\n# FAQ\r\n\r\n\r\n- **What’s with the hex chars floating all over the code?**\r\n\r\n\tMostly WhatsApp’s proprietary control chars/commands, or formatted data according to their server’s specifications, stored in predefined dictionaries within the clients.\r\n\r\n- **What’s your future development plans?**\r\n\r\n\tWe don’t have any.\r\n\r\n- **Would it run over the web?**\r\n\r\n\tWe’ve tested a slightly-modified version on top of Tornado Web Server and worked like a charm, however, building a chat client is a bit tricky, do your research.\r\n\r\n- **Can I receive chats?**\r\n\r\n\tIndeed, using the same socket-receiving mechanism. But you have to parse the incoming data. Parsing functions aren’t included in this release, maybe in the next one?\r\n\r\n- **I think the code is messy.**\r\n\r\n\tIt’s working.\r\n\r\n- **How can I obtain my password?**\r\n\r\n\tRegister a number using WhatsAPI or intercept your phone's password using MissVenom\r\n\r\n# NOTES\r\n\r\n- This proof of concept is extensible to contain every feature that make a fully-fledged client, similar to the official ones, actually could be even better.\r\n\r\n- During the two weeks of analysis of service mechanisms, we stumbled upon serious design and security flaws (they fixed some of them since 2011). For a company with such massive user base, we expected better practises and engineering.\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nMIT - refer to the source code for the extra line.\r\n\r\n# Venomous\r\n\r\nTeam of Bahraini Developers.\r\n\r\nAhmed Moh'd ([fb.com/ahmed.mhd](https://www.facebook.com/ahmed.mhd)) and Ali Hubail ([@hubail](https://twitter.com/hubail)) contributed to this release.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
